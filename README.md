***Rip and tear until it is done.***

I'm a human bean (maybe I'm also a zombie since my brain is rotting) who goes around pretending to be an evil version of a pixelated dragon. I mainly make mods for Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited

I like Sonic, Mega Man, Mario, Doom, Linux, Dogs and computing in general.

**MY PROJECTS**
Contributions are welcome on all of my projects!

[Scoring Revisited](https://github.com/ShadowXeldron/S3AIR-Scoring-Revisited) - A mod that adds a Sonic Adventure 2-inspired ranking system to Sonic 3 AIR. This is my main project right now.
[ShadowXeldron's S3AIR Mods](https://github.com/ShadowXeldron/ShadowXeldrons-S3AIR-Mods) - A repository for some of my smaller and more audio-focused Sonic submissions.
[Pokemon FireRed Xeldromix](https://github.com/ShadowXeldron/pokefirered-xeldromix) - A work-in-progress decompilation hack of Pokemon FireRed which adds a physical special split and loads of moves as well as the evolved forms of certain Pokemon who got evolutions in later generations. The hack is intended to run on real hardware.
[SMBX: Legend of the Dark Door](https://github.com/ShadowXeldron/pokefirered-xeldromix) - A level pack for SMBX2 which is intended to be an RPG-styled metroidvania episode.
[Stats.lua](https://gist.github.com/ShadowXeldron/53abdf8b765851d8d76933bf1dd020c2) - A script for SMBX2 which adds in some simple RPG mechanics.
